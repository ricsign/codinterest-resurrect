<h3 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h3>
<p>A rotten fruit will decompose in the soil, and provides the soil nutritions. Therefore other plants will have better growth. Every fruit has a nutrition value of <em>n</em>, where <em>n</em> is a positive integer. The process of decomposition yields to the following:</p>
<p>1- A fruit piece has nutrition value of <em>n</em> will decompose into two smaller fruit pieces having nutrition values of <em>m</em> and <em>n/m</em>, where <em>m</em> is <em>n</em>’s smallest prime factor with <em>m</em> is strictly less than <em>n</em>. So now there’re 2 fruit pieces after decomposition.</p>
<p>2- Keep decomposing the fruit pieces as many as possible, until no more fruit piece can be decomposed into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>Return the sum of nutrition value of all final fruit pieces that cannot be further decomposed.</p>
<p>(*Note: You can always re-decompose a decomposed fruit piece, as long as it meets the decomposition requirements)</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><strong>Input 1:</strong>  <em>n</em> = 12<br>
<strong>Output 1:</strong>  7<br>
<strong>Explanation 1:</strong> Initially, the fruit has nutrition value of 12, it can decompose into pieces of 2 and 6, for the first piece, it cannot be decomposed again, but for the second piece, it can be further decomposed into pieces of 2 and 3, note both of these two pieces are not possible to re-decompose, so the final fruit pieces we cannot decompose further are with nutrition value of 2,2,3, and 2+2+3 = 7, therefore yield 7.<br>
<strong>Input 2:</strong>  <em>n</em> = 32<br>
<strong>Output 2:</strong>  10</p>
