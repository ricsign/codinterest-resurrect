<h3 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h3>
<p>You are on a holiday with your family. There are <code>n</code> destinations, destination <code>i</code> has <code>attr[i]</code> attractions. You want to visit all of them with your family within <code>d</code> days, after <code>d</code> days, you need to go back to work.</p>
<p>You don’t want to miss your work, but you also want to enjoy the time with your family, visit as least attractions per day as you possibly can. Now it’s your time to decide how many attractions to visit per day.</p>
<p>Assume you decided to visit <code>k</code> attractions per day, every day, you will choose a destination, and visit <code>k</code> attractions at that destination.  However, if the destination has less than <code>k</code> attractions left to visit, you’ll visit all of them instead, remember, everyday you can only stay in 1 destination.</p>
<p>Output the minimum integer <code>k</code> such that you can visit all destinations with in <code>d</code> days.</p>
<p>(Note: <code>n</code> == <code>attr.length</code>)</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><strong>Input 1:</strong>  <code>n = 4, d = 10, attr = [2,3,5,9]</code><br>
<strong>Output 1:</strong> 3<br>
<strong>Explanation 1:</strong> The least number of attractions you and your family visit per day is 3. Verify 3 does work: for <code>attr[0]</code>, you will spend 1 day,  for <code>attr[1]</code>, you will spend 1 day, for <code>attr[2]</code>, you will spend 2 days, for <code>attr[3]</code>, you will spend 3 days, in total you will spend 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 days, 7 &lt;= 10, so 3 does work. Now verify that the maximum integer less than 3, namely 2 doesn’t work. If you visit maximum of 2 attractions per day, for <code>attr[0]</code>, you will spend 1 day, for <code>attr[1]</code>, you will spend 2 days, for <code>attr[2]</code>, you will spend 3 days, for <code>attr[3]</code>, you will spend 5 days, in total you will spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11 days, 11 &gt; 10, so 2 doesn’t work. Hence <code>k</code> = 3.<br>
<strong>Input 2:</strong>  <code>n = 5, d = 28, attr = [10,23,12,98,15]</code><br>
<strong>Output 2:</strong>  6</p>
<h3 id="testcases">Testcases</h3>
<p><strong>Number of Testcases:</strong> 7<br>
<strong>Specification:</strong> Every testcase consists two line, the first line consist <code>n</code> and <code>d</code>, the second line will be <code>attr</code> consist <code>n</code> integers, every integer represent the number of attractions at that corresponding destination. To be clear, every testcase will seperate by a line.<br>
