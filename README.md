# Documentation: how does my project work?

## Design Pattern

![MVC Model](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*7LesGFlzQzpGiP8m)

#### Model

The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

#### View

Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

#### Controller

Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.


## Structure

#### The App Directory

The  `app`  directory contains the core code of the application, such as Controllers and Models. 

#### The Bootstrap Directory

The  `bootstrap`  directory contains the  `app.php`  file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also houses a  `cache`  directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.

#### The Config Directory

The  `config`  directory, as the name implies, contains all of the application's configuration files.

#### The Database Directory

The  `database`  directory contains the database migrations, model factories, and seeds.

#### The Public Directory

The  `public`  directory contains the  `index.php`  file, which is the entry point for all requests entering the application and configures autoloading. This directory also houses the assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.

#### The Resources Directory

The  `resources`  directory contains your views as well as the raw, un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. This directory also houses all of your language files.

#### The Routes Directory

The  `routes`  directory contains all of the route definitions for the application. By default, several route files are included with Laravel:  `web.php`,  `api.php`,  `console.php`  and  `channels.php`.

The  `web.php`  file contains routes that the  `RouteServiceProvider`  places in the  `web`  middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption.

#### The Storage Directory

The  `storage`  directory contains all compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into  `app`,  `framework`, and  `logs`  directories. 


#### The Tests Directory

The  `tests`  directory contains the automated tests.

#### The Vendor Directory

The  `vendor`  directory contains all  [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)  dependencies.
