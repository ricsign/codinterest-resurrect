# Documentation: how does my project work?

## Comments
Name: Richard Shuai

Date Start: September 8th

Date Completed: October 23rd

Class: Computer Science 30

Teacher: Mr. Schellenberg

Project: Capstone Coding Project (Codinterest)

Extra For Expert:
1. Knowledge from CS 30: Utilize lots of stuff learned in this semester, such as array, map, recursion, object-oriented programming, libraries and etc.
2. Knowledge from outside the class: A considerable amount of code is from self-learning, I did not use others code (except libraries), majority of it is learned from official documentation, and I implemented them on my own.
3. Effort: This website is a medium-scale program, I developed front end, back end, problems & solutions and database all by myself. I did put lots of effort in this project. On the way, I conquered a few challenging modules I've never done before: MVC, ajax, email activation and reset, captcha verification code and a lot more. During developing, my laptop crashed, so I lost at least 20% of my progress at that time, I have to revert to the previous version and set up a new local enviornment, therefore I have 2 repos on Github: codinterest and codinterest-resurrect. 


**Note For Grading:**  
To run laravel, you will need to install XAMPP(recommended)/Apache+MySQL and package manager Composer

## Files Information (Important)

- All SQL files are stored in \App\SQL directory
- All controllers are stored in \App\Http\Controllers file  
- All models are stored in \App\Models directory
- All views are stored in \Resources\views directory
- All external JS, CSS, HTML, images, articles, problems are stored in \Public directory
- All configurations are stored in \Config  directory
- All middlewares are stored in \App\Http\Middlewares directory

## Design Pattern

![MVC Model](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*7LesGFlzQzpGiP8m)

#### Model

The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

#### View

Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

#### Controller

Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.


## Structure

#### The App Directory

The  `app`  directory contains the core code of the application, such as Controllers and Models. 

#### The Bootstrap Directory

The  `bootstrap`  directory contains the  `app.php`  file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also houses a  `cache`  directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.

#### The Config Directory

The  `config`  directory, as the name implies, contains all of the application's configuration files.

#### The Database Directory

The  `database`  directory contains the database migrations, model factories, and seeds.

#### The Public Directory

The  `public`  directory contains the  `index.php`  file, which is the entry point for all requests entering the application and configures autoloading. This directory also houses the assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.

#### The Resources Directory

The  `resources`  directory contains your views as well as the raw, un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript. This directory also houses all of your language files.

#### The Routes Directory

The  `routes`  directory contains all of the route definitions for the application. By default, several route files are included with Laravel:  `web.php`,  `api.php`,  `console.php`  and  `channels.php`.

The  `web.php`  file contains routes that the  `RouteServiceProvider`  places in the  `web`  middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption.

#### The Storage Directory

The  `storage`  directory contains all compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into  `app`,  `framework`, and  `logs`  directories. 


#### The Tests Directory

The  `tests`  directory contains the automated tests.

#### The Vendor Directory

The  `vendor`  directory contains all  [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)  dependencies.

## Languages

#### Database
MySQL

#### Back End
A pure PHP framework Laravel.

#### Front End
Blade View, HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, Jquery (JS lib), Bootstrap (CSS lib), Layui (CSS lib), Markdown.

#### Solution
C++


## Developing Process

#### Plan a module
Have a sense of where I am going to develop a module, how to set up the database, how to configure the model. 

#### Start from static front-end (V)
I'll first develop the front-end, this is my least favorite part of developing. I'm not much a design person, so it takes a lot of time to choose a font, color, background image and etc.

#### Proceed to database & model (M)
Then, I'll create a prototype database with the requirements, and then I'll set up the model.

#### Proceed to controller \(C\)
Controllers are where I implement logics, and connect views and models. It is essential for a module.

#### Back to view (V)
Replace all static data to dynamic data from controller.

#### Review & Integration
Then, I'll go back and forth between controllers and views, make sure it's functioning as expected. In the end, I'll integrate the module into the project.


## Problems Process

#### Find/Create a cool problem
Find a problem online(usually leetcode and cemc) or create my own problems that I think it encompasses some important ideas.

#### Write description
Write down problem description

#### Write solution
Then, I'll figure a solution, and test it over and over again, making sure it's correct.

#### Create testcases
Yes, you're right, I have to type all testcases into my program and then run my program to get the answers. That is why a correct solution is essential

#### Convert it to markdown
Then, I'll go to a markdown editor(Stackedit) and reformat it.

#### Export it as HTML
After some refurbishing, I will export the md to html file.

#### Upload to database
Making sure everything is working properly, then, I'll upload my problem to the database.
