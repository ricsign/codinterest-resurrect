# Reflection

#### What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

If I am going to start over again, I'll have a much further/more detailed plan. For this project, I have a broad plan about where I wish my project will go, how do some core modules look like and etc. However, my plan was not detailed enough, for example, I did not plan ahead to my function/variable names, and I ended up with a little bit of disappointment. Secondly, I also wish I could've spent less time on styles, I would probably focus on functionalities a little more based on the time frame we have. I realized how much time I wasted on styles, just to pick a better font, color, size, alignment and etc. I think that is what I should also be planning ahead of time. Thirdly, I wish I can get more familiar with projects have scales like this one. This is the largest project I have ever done in computer science (I feel bad about that), and I hope I could've practiced a little before actually doing the project.

#### Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

Yes, I have completed everything in my "needs to have" list in my proposal. In fact, I also have some of "nice to have" list and some other things completed.

#### What was the hardest part of the project?

In my opinion, I would probably say the security part. I  know  Laravel has a built-in anti-SQL Injection and an  anti-CSRF system. Regardless, my knowledge of web security is unsatisfying, every time  I  develop a module, I will keep one thing in mind: "Do not trust users' input", and the  majority  of the  time,  I  can  figure  it out. However, a sacrifice  I  have to make  is the styles, for example, the most secure way for users to view is put their markdown is in a textarea, however, this will result in getting the HTML code instead of getting the actual "view". I  understand  my web security is weak, so  I  have  to  look  up  some  books  and  websites, to learn how to  prevent  malicious inputs. Now  my  website  can  prevent  some  basic hackings  (you can try some XSS; it won't  work.),  but unfortunately, this  website  is  a  piece of cake  for  some  experienced hackers.

#### Were there any problems you could not solve?

Absolutely, and not just one.  
  
1. I  can't figure out how to  prevent  DDoS, absolutely no  clue. The  only  solution  I  can  find  is buying some  companies'  products.  
2. I  don't know how to  implement  a program compiler/executer on my  website. I  did  make  a playground page on my  website, which is  basically  a JS console. The  only  thing  I  used  is  JS's  `eval()`  function. Yet  I  don't know how to  implement  this "properly".  
3. The email module  works  perfectly at my  home, however, it does not  work at  the  school. I  think  the  school's  internet  does not allow me to  do  that.
